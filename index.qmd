Hi there! I’m passionate about all things geospatial, from programming with Python and R to exploring the world of GIS and remote sensing. My journey has taken me through exciting experiences, like using RTK GPS for precise geospatial data collection and helping improve project timelines with better planning accuracy.

As a Cohort Representative for the Mastercard Foundation Scholars Program and a former President of the Geomatic Engineering Students Association, I’ve had the chance to lead, collaborate, and build communities while driving meaningful change. I thrive on using tools like ArcGIS and remote sensing to solve complex problems and deliver solutions that truly make an impact.

Whether it’s mapping, analyzing data, or diving into new challenges, I’m always eager to learn, grow, and share my knowledge. Let’s connect and explore the geospatial world together!
